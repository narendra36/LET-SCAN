# EmotionSense

Emotions are really an important part of our lives and have enough power to change it for better or bad.
so we made an android app which can detect emotions either from written text or from an image.

We build it using **Microsoft Cognitive services** and everything else is just an abstraction.

The Project is a tech hack developed for  __Hackathon 2.0__   by Team - **App Rangers**
